<body><h2><b>Rauvolfia serpentina</b></h2>
    <p>Rauvolfia serpentina, commonly known as Indian snakeroot or serpentwood,
         is a medicinal plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast 
         Asia. It has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic and other traditional
          medicinal systems for its potential health benefits.<br/><

        <p>One of the main bioactive compounds found in Rauvolfia serpentina is 
        reserpine, which has been of particular interest due to its antihypertensive
         (blood pressure-lowering) and antipsychotic properties. Reserpine was 
         historically used to treat high blood pressure and certain psychological
          disorders, but it has largely been replaced by newer medications with 
          fewer side effects.<br/>
        
        The plant's traditional uses and potential medicinal properties have led
         to scientific research exploring its various compounds and their effects
          on the human body. However, due to its complex chemistry and potential
           side effects, it's important to consult with a qualified healthcare 
           professional before using Rauvolfia serpentina or any products derived
            from it for medicinal purposes.<br>
        
        Keep in mind that my knowledge is based on information available up until
         September 2021, and there may have been further developments in research 
         or medical understanding since that time.</p>
